# Remote-Collaborative-Annotation-3D-Reconstruction
The 3D Reconstruction pipeline created within the project "Shared Annotations for Remote Guidance".

**Note:** The whole project is devided into two parts, the 3D Reconstruction part and the Annotation/Data Transmission part. This part is created by myself and contains the 3D reconstruction pipeline and its graphical user interface.

For viewer not familiar with the Xcode and Swift, the relevant files for the project are stored in the `Remote Collaborative Annotation` folder.
